Testing the basic concepts
Q1
(a) Write a Python function that takes a positive integer n, and returns the sum of the squares of all
the positive integers smaller than n.
(b) Write a Python function that takes a positive integer n, and returns the sum of the squares of all
the ​ odd ​ positive integers smaller than n.
Q2
What parameter values should be sent to the range constructor to produce a range with values:
(a) 60,70,80
(b) 4,2,0,-2,-4
Creativity
Q3
Write a Python function that takes a sequence of integer values and determines if there is a distinct pair of
numbers in the sequence whose product is ​ odd ​ .
Q4
Write a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given character string.
Q5
Write a Python program that takes as input three integers, “a”, “b” and “c”, from the console and
determines if they can be used in the following arithmetic formulas: (i) “a+b=c”, (ii) “a=b-c”, (iii) “a*b=c”.
